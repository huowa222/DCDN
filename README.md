This design document aims to elaborate on my previous work at Alibaba Cloud. It presents the  design scheme of the dynamic acceleration CDN shortest - path algorithm, which combines the  shortest - path algorithm based on two - dimensional matrices dynamic programming and deep  neural network reinforcement learning. This scheme involves the data pipeline in big - data  collection, as well as data processing, analysis, and computing, including the overall  architecture, implementation, and performance - evaluation methods of the shortest - path  algorithm. It provides comprehensive guidance for the development, testing, and deployment  of big - data processing and algorithms.
